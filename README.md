# C Days Pool — 1337 Coding School

This repository documents my progress during the **C Days Pool** of **1337 Coding School**.  
It reflects my continuous learning, daily practice, and commitment to mastering the C programming language.

## Overview

The C Pool is an intensive program focused on:
- Problem-solving
- Low-level programming
- Logical thinking
- Discipline and consistency

This repository serves as a transparent record of my journey from the first steps in C to more advanced concepts.
